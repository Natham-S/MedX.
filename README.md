### The Problem it Solves

MedX addresses several critical issues in the healthcare system, particularly in small to medium-sized clinics:

1.*Huge Medical Histories & Time Constraints*: Doctors often face the challenge of sifting through extensive medical records during patient consultations, which can be time-consuming and overwhelming. MedX's medical history summarizer uses cutting-edge natural language processing to quickly analyze these records and provide concise summaries, enabling doctors to make efficient and informed decisions.

2.*Allergen Risk in Medications*: Patients with allergies are at risk of adverse reactions to certain medications. The Medicine Checker feature cross-references a patient’s medical history and allergy reports with prescribed medications to ensure they do not contain any allergens that could cause harmful reactions.

3.*Long Waiting Times at Clinics*: Small to medium-sized clinics often struggle with managing patient flow, leading to long waiting times. Queue+ is a smart appointment booking application that intelligently analyzes the position in the queue and the average waiting time to significantly reduce in-clinic waiting times.
